# Economic-PPI-Health-Indicator

## Overview
Hi, I'm Nathan Reid - a current senior at UF - I'm attempting to build a AI-driven data analysis tool that is designed to interpret PPI data to evaluate the importance of commodities within the US economy. Millions of individuals - from farmers and manufacturers to investors and brokerages - rely on the production, import, and export of commodities like corn, cotton, palladium, and other natural resources. By analyzing multi-year datasets published by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, my tool seeks to identify trends, correlations, and shifts in economic influence across different sectors of the economy. My goal is to leverage machine learning to see how we can transform data into actionable government insights that can lead to decision making at every level. Whether it be research, finance, or policy, I want to make a tool that better helps the user understand market dynamics, forecast changes in production (weather, labor shortages, etc) and make informed decisions. This project also serves as a deep-dive into how AI can enhance traditional economic analysis by processing large volumes of data and uncovering patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed!
